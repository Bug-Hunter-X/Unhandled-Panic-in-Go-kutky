This repository demonstrates a common error in Go programs where panics are not handled correctly. The `calculate` function panics if the divisor is zero. The `main` function attempts to call `calculate` with a divisor of zero, which causes a panic. The program crashes without any meaningful error message. The solution demonstrates how to use the `recover` function to handle the panic, preventing the program from crashing. The solution also includes detailed error messages, which help in debugging.
